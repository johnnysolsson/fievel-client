# ErrorBoundary Component

The `ErrorBoundary` component is a React class component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

## Props

| Prop | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | The child components to be wrapped and monitored for errors. |

## Behavior

- **Catch Errors**: Uses `componentDidCatch` to log error details to the console.
- **Fallback UI**: If an error occurs, it renders a simple `<h1>Oops! Something went wrong.</h1>` message.
- **Normal Rendering**: If no error occurs, it renders its `children` as normal.

## Usage

Wrap your main application or specific sections of your app with `ErrorBoundary` to prevent the entire app from crashing due to a local error.

```tsx
import ErrorBoundary from "./components/ErrorBoundary";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <App />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  </React.StrictMode>
);
```
